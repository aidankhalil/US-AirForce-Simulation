# Systems Simulation Developer – United States Air Force, Warner Robins ALC

**Duration:** Feb 2025 – Apr 2025

## Overview
Built a subsystem-level process mapping simulation in AnyLogic to optimize task-routing and throughput for the United States Air Force’s 402nd MXSG.

## Features
- Parsed and structured real ALC personnel data to simulate bottlenecks, idle states, and resource handoffs under mission-relevant load conditions.
- Tuned parameters to compare baseline vs. functional cell models, producing simulation-based recommendations to optimize workforce structure.

## Technologies Used
Simulation modeling, AnyLogic, discrete-event simulation, process optimization, Java, UI/UX development, queue based operations
