# USAF x USF Capstone/Senior Project Spring 2025
# Process Mapping Simulation – United States Air Force, Warner Robins ALC

**Duration:** Feb 2025 – Apr 2025

## Overview
Built a subsystem-level process mapping simulation in AnyLogic to optimize program manager allocation and test a new workflow model for the United States Air Force’s 402nd MXSG.

## Features
- Parsed and structured real ALC personnel data to simulate bottlenecks, idle states, and resource handoffs under mission-relevant load conditions.
- Tuned parameters to compare baseline vs. functional cell models, producing simulation-based recommendations to optimize workforce structure.

## Technologies & Skills Used
AnyLogic, discrete-event simulation, process optimization, Java, UI/UX development, queue based operations

## How to Install / Setup Instructions
1. Click the green **Code** button in this repository.
2. Select **Download ZIP**.
3. Locate the downloaded file, right-click it, and choose **Extract All**.

## How to Run
1. Open **AnyLogic**.
2. Go to **File > Open**.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder containing:
   - The AnyLogic simulation model
   - `MXDEI Model.xlsx`
   - `Profiles.xlsx`
   - `database` folder (includes `db.properties` and `db.script`)
4. With the model open, click the green **Play** button (or press **F5**) to run the simulation. (Note: An entire workyear is simulated, it is recommended to turn the simulation speed to atleast 5x)
